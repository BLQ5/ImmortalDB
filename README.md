### IronDB is a resilient key-value store for the browser.

IronDB is the best way to store persistent key-value data in the browser. Data
saved to IronDB is redundantly stored in
[Cookies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies),
[IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API),
[LocalStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage),
and
[SessionStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage),
and relentlessly self heals if any data therein is deleted or corrupted.

For example, clearing cookies is a common user action, even for relatively
non-technical users. And browsers will unceremoniously
[delete](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API/Browser_storage_limits_and_eviction_criteria#LRU_policy)
IndexedDB, LocalStorage, and/or SessionStorage without warning under storage
pressure.

IronDB is resilient in the face of such events.

In this way, IronDB is like [Evercookie](https://github.com/samyk/evercookie),
but

  1. Is actively maintained and well documented.

  2. Provides a simple, modern, Promise-based API.

  3. Strikes an equitable balance between reliability and respect for the
     user. Data is stored reliably but can also be voluntarily purged if the
     user designedly clears cookies and application storage.

  4. Doesn't use nefarious exploits nor deprecated third party plugins like
     Flash, Silverlight, or Java. Only standard, ratified HTML5 APIs are used.

  5. Doesn't vandalize performance or the user experience. For example,
     Evercookie's CSS History Knocking can beget a deluge of background HTTP
     requests, and loading Silverlight or Flash can raise unsought permission
     modals or thrash the user's disk.


### How IronDB works.

When you store a key-value pair in IronDB, that key and value are saved
redundantly in the browser's cookies, IndexedDB, LocalStorage, and
SessionStorage data stores.

When a value is retrieved via its key, IronDB

  1. Looks up that key in every data store.
  2. Counts each unique returned value.
  3. Determines the most commonly returned unique value as the 'correct' value.
  4. Returns this correct value.

Then IronDB self-heals: if any data store(s) returned a value different than the
determined correct value, or no value at all, the correct value is rewritten to
that store. In this way, consensus, reliability, and redundancy is maintained.


### API

#### Set()

IronDB's API is simple. To store a value, use `set(key, value)`:

```javascript
import { IronDB } from 'iron-db'

await IronDB.set('key', 'value')
```

`key` and `value` must be
[DOMStrings](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMString).
`IronDB.set(key, value)` also always returns `value`, so it can be chained or
embedded, like

```javascript
const countPlusOne = (await IronDB.set('count', countNumberOfClowns())) + 1
```

#### Get()

To retrieve a value, use `get(key, default=null)`:

```javascript
const value = await IronDB.get('key', default=null)
```

`get()` returns the value associated with `key`, if `key` exists. If `key`
doesn't exist, `default` is returned. `key` must be a
[DOMString](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMString).

#### Remove()

Finally, to remove a key, use `remove(key)`:

```javascript
IronDB.set('hi', 'bonjour')
console.log(await IronDB.get('hi'))  // Prints 'bonjour'.

await IronDB.remove('hi')

console.log(await IronDB.get('hi')) // Prints 'null'.
```

`key` must be a
[DOMString](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMString).

#### Data Stores

The data stores that IronDB stores data in can also be configured. For example,
to only store data reliably in cookies and LocalStorage:

```javascript
import { IronStorage, CookieStore, LocalStorageStore } from 'iron-db'

const stores = [new CookieStore(), new LocalStorageStore()]
const db = IronStorage(stores)

await db.set('key', JSON.Stringify({1:1}))
```

Available stores are

  - CookieStore -> Keys and values are stored in `document.cookie`.
  - IndexedDbStore -> Keys and values are stored in `window.indexedDB`.
  - LocalStorageStore -> Keys and values are stored in `window.localStorage`.
  - SessionStorageStore -> Keys and values are stored in `window.sessionStorage`.

New storage implementations can easily be added, too; they need only implement
the methods `get(key, default)`, `set(key, value)`, and `remove(key)`.


### Installation

Installing IronDB with npm is easy.

```
$ npm install iron-db
```

Or include `dist/iron-db[.min].js` and use `window.IronDB` directly.

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <script src="iron-db.min.js"></script>
    <script>
      (async () => {
          const db = IronDB.IronDB;
          await db.set('hi', 'lolsup');
      })();
    </script>
  </head>

  ...
</html>
```
